### Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive library for accessing and processing geomagnetic indices, specifically the Kp and Ap indices.

#### Key Features
- **Data Access**: The package includes modules for downloading data from specific FTP servers.
- **Data Processing**: Functions to read, parse, and structure the downloaded data into usable formats.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tools for analyzing time series data of geomagnetic indices.
- **Visualization**: Capabilities to generate plots for visualizing patterns in the indices.

          <h4>Detailed Documentation</h4>
          Each module in the package contains functions to perform specific tasks, such as reading different data formats (ASCII, GMT, etc.), performing calculations, and generating visualizations. For example:

- `_readKpApSNF107.py` handles reading SN F107 data
- `_ReadKpGMT.py` focuses on GMT formatted data
- `_ReadKpASCII.py` deals with ASCII text files

The package also includes functionality for time series analysis and generating reports.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the module-level docstrings or consult the project documentation available at [GitHub](link).
